# DebateSearch
A simple website I wrote at the tail end of grade 11. It allowed users to search through their most commonly used words on the Debate Club Edsby[^1] page. The backend is a separate repo that I'm keeping private because it has all of the students' names in it, but it was a simple Python project written in Flask - my first experience with writing an API, and one of my first experiences using one. A great learning experience that proved somewhat useful to the students of my school in the end.
